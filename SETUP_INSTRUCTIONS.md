1. Use the admin panel after logging in
2. Run the `checkAndAddUsers.js` script in the backend directory
3. Modify the script to add different user types

### 6. Troubleshooting

If you still get "user not found" error:

1. Make sure MongoDB is running
2. Check that the backend server is running on port 4000
3. Verify the `.env` files are properly configured
4. Ensure the frontend is pointing to the correct API URL

## Default Admin User (from seed data)

There's also a default admin user created by the seed script:
- **Email:** admin@gmail.com
- **Password:** admin123

## API Endpoints

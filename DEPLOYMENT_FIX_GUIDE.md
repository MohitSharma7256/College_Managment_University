# College Management System - Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend-Backend Connection
- ✅ Updated backend CORS configuration to allow production frontend URL
- ✅ Frontend `.env` already configured with correct backend URLs
- ✅ Added robust CORS handling for both development and production

### 2. Build Output Directory Issue
- ✅ Updated Vite config to output to `dist` directory
- ✅ Created `render.yaml` for proper Render deployment configuration
- ✅ Added `_redirects` file for SPA routing support

### 3. Backend CORS Configuration
- ✅ Fixed CORS to allow multiple origins (dev + production)
- ✅ Updated PORT configuration to use environment variable correctly
- ✅ Added credentials support for authenticated requests

## Deployment URLs
- **Backend**: https://college-managment-university.onrender.com
- **Frontend**: https://college-managment-university-frontend.onrender.com

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. `backend/.env` - Updated FRONTEND_API_LINK to production URL
2. `backend/index.js` - Enhanced CORS configuration and fixed PORT

### Frontend Changes
1. `frontend/vite.config.js` - Added build configuration
2. `frontend/render.yaml` - Created Render deployment config
3. `frontend/_redirects` - Added SPA routing support

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and push changes to GitHub**
2. **Redeploy backend on Render** - The CORS changes will take effect
3. **Redeploy frontend on Render** - The build configuration will now work correctly

## Build Process Fix
The original error was caused by:
- Render expecting `dist` directory but build was configured for React Scripts
- CORS blocking requests from production frontend
- Missing SPA routing configuration

All these issues have been resolved.
